#Welcome to the Kino Webring Git!

## REQUIREMENTS:
- Minimal JS usage (librejs is recommended)
- Original style and content
- No trackers, analytics or any bs
- No NSFW
- Don't scrape content from other members' websites

## WHAT MAKES A WEBSITE KINO
* Original or old design not used very commonly
* Redpilled content that has purpose
* Fast and lightweight
* Use your own assets, don't href it from somewhere else (CSS, JS, et al)


## HOW TO JOIN
* Submit a 240x60 web banner (they can either be PNG, JPG, or GIF, if you really must you can also import SVG although I consider it experimental)
* Include your site name
* Make a short description of it (in case people want to include in their webring page)

## HOW TO MAKE A BANNER
Personally I used GIMP, but it's very blurry and painful to use with the 240x60 canvas, so I suggest upscaling it. You can also use krita or even inkscape. You can inspire from existing banners, or follow some basic tutorials, they're plenty.

## HOW TO MAKE A WEBSITE
There are countless tutorials online. Personally I think HTML is dead simple, CSS can be quite a chore tho. There is no excuse not knowing the basics of HTML.
